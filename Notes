if the specified ip in vagrant is on same network as host or bridge network, then change it.
error is:
The specified host network collides with a non-hostonly network!
This will cause your specified IP to be inaccessible. Please change
the IP or name of your host only network so that it no longer matches that of
a bridged or non-hostonly network.

Bridged Network Address: '192.168.1.0'
Host-only Network 'wlp3s0': '192.168.1.0'

Changed it to 192.168.2.101 and it worked:
Vagrantfile entry:     master.vm.network 'private_network', ip: "192.168.2.101"
============

when doing kubeadm config images pull
you should see:
[root@k8s-master ~]# kubeadm config images pull
[config/images] Pulled registry.k8s.io/kube-apiserver:v1.30.2
[config/images] Pulled registry.k8s.io/kube-controller-manager:v1.30.2
[config/images] Pulled registry.k8s.io/kube-scheduler:v1.30.2
[config/images] Pulled registry.k8s.io/kube-proxy:v1.30.2
[config/images] Pulled registry.k8s.io/coredns/coredns:v1.11.1
[config/images] Pulled registry.k8s.io/pause:3.9
[config/images] Pulled registry.k8s.io/etcd:3.5.12-0

==================

if during kubeadm init there is a problem with health checks of api-server or kubelet, then kudeadm reset and then try the kubeadm init again.
for e.g if the api-server-address IP is wrong, it will fail
=============

if you edit your Vagrantfile and make changes to it while the provisioning is going on, you may get an error like:
Your VM has become "inaccessible." Unfortunately, this is a critical error
with VirtualBox that Vagrant can not cleanly recover from. Please open VirtualBox
and clear out your inaccessible virtual machines or find a way to fix
them.
If the error recurs, remove the entire vagrant installation and add a new centos/7 box and restart Vagrant
also check /root/.config/VirtualBox.xml-prev. It may need to be copied over onto the original xml.
===========

If you have more than 1 node ( the default! ) then to get status info or the ability to ssh into the node
you need to either have an env variable set: export NODES=2 or run 
NODES=2 vagrant ssh node-2
or
NODES=2 vagrant status
